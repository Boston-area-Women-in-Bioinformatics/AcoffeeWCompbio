      "description": "<p>In our first episode, Alex and Lorena dive into the messy reality of processing single-cell RNA-seq data. What started as a simple QC project turned into a week-long journey across compute environments, mysterious pipeline errors, and zero-cell outputs. Along the way, we troubleshoot issues with Cell Ranger, uncover strange sequencing artifacts, and reflect on lessons in data handling, pipeline reproducibility, and client communication.</p><p><br /></p><p>Follow us on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lpantano/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/lpantano/</a>  and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-bartlett-926b32109/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-bartlett-926b32109/</a></p><p><br /></p><p>If you enjoyed the episode, please subscribe and leave us a review.</p><br /><p>Hosted on Ausha.
