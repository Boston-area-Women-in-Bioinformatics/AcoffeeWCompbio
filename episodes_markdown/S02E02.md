## Description

Hackathons are not just for coders anymore — computational biologists have made it their own with data, models, and insights! Hackathons can be a great way to understand the trends in your field, meet new people, and network. Do you want to try and participate in a hackathon this year and feel like a true hacker? The wait is over — in this episode we give you all the tea about hackathons, over a cup of coffee! Tune into our latest episode of "A Coffee with CompBio" where Sharvari Narendra and Saba Nafees talk about hackathons and more!

If you think you know some more hackathon-related resources, let us know in the comments and we will give you a shoutout in the next episode!
